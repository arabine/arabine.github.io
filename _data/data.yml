career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm a C/C++ developer, mainly embedded and Qt/QML. I'm freelancer since 2018, before that I worked in electricity meters (firmware + R&D tools).
      I'm also deeply interested in all aspects of computer programming, especially Web technologies: there are multiple bridges between languages.
      I have also developed some Android applications, in Qt of course! Depending of the project, I can work with alternative GUI frameworks such as LVGL or ImGUI.
      
      My key skills are:
        - Very good computer engineering culture
        - hability to mix technologies
        - software static/dynamic architecture
        - proactive, propose solutions
            
      I can work for you! Here is my corporate website: <a href="https://www.d8s.eu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">D8S EURL</a>
